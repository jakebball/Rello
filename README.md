This first tab is the settings tab where you configure your API Key, Token and Board Id. To get your API Key and Token visit this link https://trello.com/app-key and follow the directions. After that you need to input your BoardID which is the numbers and letters in the trello link after the /b/.

# Publish

Once you go through the steps and click create it will then bring you back to the main menu where you can now publish your changes. There will be status info on the bottom left of the window that will state if it sucessfully published changes. If the status info states it was successful but it did not change in the trello make sure to check your info and that all the fields are valid such as checking if you mistyped a list name. If it errors you can send me the error info which will be printed out into the studio output. I can be contacted on this github, the devforum page, or my discord jakebball11#3826.
